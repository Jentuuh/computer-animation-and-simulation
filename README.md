# Vulkan Animation Engine
An animation engine created in Vulkan for my 'Computer Animation And Simulation' course.

## Features 
* Spline-based path animation governed by speed control functions (making use of Catmull-Rom splines)
* Object deformation by manipulating a deformation grid
* Particle system with collision detection + response
* L-Systems
* Forward + inverse (2D) kinematics
* Game object manipulation (scale, rotation, translation)
* Save/load system
* Storyboard manager that allows to manage keyframes
* Skybox
